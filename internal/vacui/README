VacUI

Stands for Vacule UI; It is a simple framebuffer UI system for
displaying pixels on the screen using OpenGL or OpenGL-ES.

It is named after the concept of a vacule, as the data is just shipped out
of your application and displayed on the screen.

The biology metaphor, I admit, is kinda stretched. Oh well.

It works on desktop or embedded, using C ABI functionality.

`hare build -lglfw3 -lGL -T+GL` or `hare build -lglfw3 -lGLESv2 -T+GLES`
